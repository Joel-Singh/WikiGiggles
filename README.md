# WikiGiggles
A project not fully done out because of a bad fundamental idea. The idea was to automatically find funny revisions on wikipedia pages and then display them. As I worked on it, the more I felt it was fundamentally flawed, so I polished what I already had and called it a day.

It currently finds revisions that were immediately reverted and displays them. I find anything related to politics has results, try typing in "Donald Trump" or "Joe Biden".

# Inspiration
A saw a couple of projects that utilized the mediaWiki API and I wanted to try doing the same thing. As I was perusing wikipedia I noticed some funny revisions and thought the finding of those could be automated.

# Technologies
Uses Svelte, Vite, Typescript, and Tailwind
